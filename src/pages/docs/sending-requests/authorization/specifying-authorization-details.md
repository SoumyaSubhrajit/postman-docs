With a request open in Postman, use the __Authorization__ tab to select an auth type, then complete the relevant details for your selected type. The correct data values will be determined by your API at the server side. If you're using a third party API, refer to the provider's documentation for any required auth details.

> Easier API authentication is available for certain public APIs. For more information, see [Authentication for public APIs](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authentication-for-public-apis/).

> You can use these auth types with Newman and monitors as well as in Postman.

When you select a type from the **Type** dropdown list, Postman will indicate which parts of the request your details will be included in, for example the header, body, URL, or query parameters. Postman adds your auth details to the relevant parts of the request when you select or enter them, so you can preview how your data will be sent before you run the request.

Your auth data will appear in the relevant parts of the request, for example in the __Headers__ tab. To show headers that were added automatically, select __hidden__.

Hover over a header to get information about where it was added. To change an auth header, return to the __Authorization__ tab and update your configuration.

> You can't override headers added by your __Authorization__ selections directly in the __Headers__ tab. If you need different auth headers from those autogenerated by Postman, alter your setup in __Authorization__, or remove your auth setup and add headers manually.

Your request auth can use environment, collection, and global [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/). Postman doesn't save header data or query parameters to avoid exposing sensitive data such as API keys.

You can inspect a raw dump of the entire request including auth data in the Postman Console after you send it.

## Inheriting authorization

If you group your requests in [collections](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/) and folders, you can specify auth details to reuse throughout a group.

By default, requests inside the collection or folder will inherit auth from the parent, which means that they'll use the same auth that you've specified at the folder or collection level. To change this for an individual request, make a different selection in the request __Authorization__ tab.
