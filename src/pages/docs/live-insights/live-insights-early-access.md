The rise of SaaS and APIs means that production systems are more complex than ever before. The Postman vision for Live Insights is to make it faster and easier for any developer to understand their production behavior. By passively watching your API traffic, Live Insights provides API-centric data about what's going wrong with a system and where to start addressing the issue.

Advantages of using _Postman Live Insights_:

*	The drop-in Live Collections Agent doesn't require instrumentation, recompilation, or invasive proxies.
*	Designed to be accessible to team members who may not be familiar with a service at the level of its logs.
*	Useful for small, fast-moving teams who may not have the expertise or resources to configure and support more expensive or complex solutions.
*	Enables a single engineer or tech lead in a smaller organization to set up in less than an hour.

In the near future, Postman users will be able to observe:

*	Consolidated, per-endpoint metrics and insights
*	Error pattern analysis
*	More context about errors, enabling easier troubleshooting
*	More automated insights

The Live Insights team is hoping you will try out the new features and send your feedback to help Postman continue tailoring the product to your needs.
