Welcome to Postman! This section of the Learning Center contains a quick guide on how to first get started with the Postman app.

In this section, you'll learn how to get the Postman app, send an API request, write your first test, and save requests to a Postman Collection. You'll also learn about working with your team in Postman and using the Public API Network.

After you've learned the basics, find out how to [take your next steps in Postman](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/next-steps/).
